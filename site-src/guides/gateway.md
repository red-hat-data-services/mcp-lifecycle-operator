# Gateway Integration

The MCP Lifecycle Operator supports exposing MCP servers through external gateways. This allows clients outside the cluster to reach MCP servers via a shared ingress point, without requiring individual LoadBalancer services per server.

## How It Works

The gateway integration uses a provider-based design built around the `MCPGatewayBinding` CRD:

1. You configure `spec.gateway` on an MCPServer with a provider name and optional configuration
2. The operator creates an `MCPGatewayBinding` resource
3. An integration controller watches bindings for its provider and creates the appropriate gateway resources
4. The binding status is reflected back into the MCPServer status

```mermaid
graph LR
    User[User] -->|configures| MCPServer[MCPServer<br/>spec.gateway]
    MCPServer -->|creates| Binding[MCPGatewayBinding]
    Binding -->|watched by| Controller[Integration<br/>Controller]
    Controller -->|creates| Resources[Provider-specific<br/>Resources]
    Resources -->|routes via| Gateway[Gateway /<br/>Ingress / etc.]
    Gateway -->|traffic| Service[MCP Server<br/>Service]
```

This design is extensible - any provider can implement its own integration controller by watching `MCPGatewayBinding` resources filtered by `spec.provider`. The operator ships with two built-in providers: `httproute` for the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) and `kuadrant` for the [Kuadrant MCP Gateway](https://docs.kuadrant.io/latest/mcp-gateway/).

## MCPServer Configuration

Add `spec.gateway` to your MCPServer to enable gateway integration:

```yaml
apiVersion: mcp.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: my-mcp-server
  namespace: default
spec:
  source:
    type: ContainerImage
    containerImage:
      ref: quay.io/containers/kubernetes_mcp_server:latest
  config:
    port: 8080
    path: /mcp
  gateway:
    provider: httproute
    configRef: mcp-gateway-config
```

| Field              | Required | Description                                                      |
|--------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gateway.provider` | Yes      | Provider name that identifies the integration controller          |
| `gateway.configRef` | No       | Name of a ConfigMap with provider-specific configuration          |

## MCPGatewayBinding

The operator automatically creates an `MCPGatewayBinding` when `spec.gateway` is set. This CRD is the contract between the operator and integration controllers:

```yaml
apiVersion: mcp.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPGatewayBinding
metadata:
  name: my-mcp-server-gateway-binding
  namespace: default
spec:
  mcpServerRef: my-mcp-server
  provider: httproute
  configRef: mcp-gateway-config
status:
  url: http://mcp.example.com/mcp
  conditions:
    - type: Registered
      status: "True"
```

!!! note
    You do not create `MCPGatewayBinding` resources manually - the operator manages their lifecycle based on `spec.gateway`.

## Status

When gateway integration is active, the MCPServer status includes:

- A `GatewayRegistered` condition indicating whether the provider has processed the binding
- A `gatewayBinding` section with the binding name and provider
- The `address.url` overridden with the gateway endpoint (if the provider sets one)

```yaml
status:
  address:
    url: http://mcp.example.com/mcp
  gatewayBinding:
    name: my-mcp-server-gateway-binding
    provider: httproute
  conditions:
    - type: Accepted
      status: "True"
    - type: Available
      status: "True"
    - type: Verified
      status: "True"
    - type: GatewayRegistered
      status: "True"
```

## Removing Gateway Integration

Remove `spec.gateway` from the MCPServer to disable gateway integration:

```bash
kubectl patch mcpserver my-mcp-server --type=json \
  -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/gateway"}]'
```

The operator deletes the `MCPGatewayBinding`, the provider's resources are cleaned up via owner references, and the MCPServer address reverts to the cluster-internal service URL.

## Reference Provider: `httproute`

The operator includes a reference integration controller for the `httproute` provider, which creates [Gateway API HTTPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/) resources.

### Prerequisites

- [Gateway API CRDs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-gateway-api) installed on the cluster
- A Gateway resource deployed and managed by a gateway controller (e.g., Envoy Gateway, Istio, Cilium)

!!! note
    The operator checks for the HTTPRoute CRD at startup. If Gateway API CRDs are not installed, the `httproute` controller is skipped. Install them and restart the operator to enable it.

### ConfigMap Format

The `httproute` provider reads its configuration from a ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mcp-gateway-config
  namespace: default
data:
  gateway-name: my-gateway
  gateway-namespace: gateway-system
  route-hostname: mcp.example.com
```

| Key                 | Required | Description                                       |
|---------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `gateway-name`      | Yes      | Name of the existing Gateway resource              |
| `gateway-namespace` | Yes      | Namespace where the Gateway resource lives          |
| `route-hostname`    | No       | Hostname to set on the HTTPRoute for routing        |
| `public-hostname`   | No       | Public hostname for the status URL. When omitted, falls back to `route-hostname`, then to the Gateway's status addresses |

!!! warning "Cross-namespace routing"
    When the Gateway lives in a different namespace than the MCPServer (as in this example), the Gateway must explicitly allow cross-namespace routes. By default, Gateway API sets `allowedRoutes.namespaces.from: Same`, which rejects routes from other namespaces. Configure the Gateway listener to accept routes from the MCPServer's namespace:

    ```yaml
    listeners:
      - name: http
        port: 80
        protocol: HTTP
        allowedRoutes:
          namespaces:
            from: All  # or use Selector to restrict to specific namespaces
    ```

### What It Creates

For each registered binding, the controller creates an HTTPRoute that:

- References the specified Gateway as a parent
- Matches the MCPServer's path (default `/mcp`) using `PathPrefix`
- Routes traffic to the MCPServer's Service and port
- Sets the hostname if configured

The HTTPRoute is owned by the MCPGatewayBinding, so it is automatically deleted when the binding is removed.

### Verify

```bash
# MCPGatewayBinding should be Registered
kubectl get mcpgatewaybindings

# HTTPRoute should exist
kubectl get httproutes

# MCPServer address should reflect the gateway URL
kubectl get mcpserver my-mcp-server -o jsonpath='{.status.address.url}'
```

## Kuadrant Provider: `kuadrant`

The operator includes an integration controller for the `kuadrant` provider, which registers MCP servers with the [Kuadrant MCP Gateway](https://docs.kuadrant.io/latest/mcp-gateway/). It creates a Gateway API HTTPRoute and a Kuadrant `MCPServerRegistration` resource that enables the MCP Gateway broker to discover and federate the server's tools and prompts.

### Prerequisites

- [Gateway API CRDs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-gateway-api) installed on the cluster
- [Kuadrant MCP Gateway](https://docs.kuadrant.io/latest/mcp-gateway/docs/guides/how-to-install-and-configure/) installed (provides the `MCPServerRegistration` CRD)
- A Gateway resource with an MCP listener (typically named `mcps`) managed by a gateway controller (e.g., Istio)

!!! note
    The operator checks for both the HTTPRoute and MCPServerRegistration CRDs at startup. If either is missing, the `kuadrant` controller is skipped. Install the required CRDs and restart the operator to enable it.

### ConfigMap Format

The `kuadrant` provider reads its configuration from a ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mcp-kuadrant-config
  namespace: default
data:
  gateway-name: mcp-gateway
  gateway-namespace: mcp-system
  prefix: myserver_
  section-name: mcps
```

| Key                 | Required | Default | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gateway-name`      | Yes      |         | Name of the existing Gateway resource                        |
| `gateway-namespace` | Yes      |         | Namespace where the Gateway resource lives                   |
| `route-hostname`    | No       | auto    | Hostname for the HTTPRoute. When omitted, auto-constructed from the Gateway listener's wildcard hostname (e.g., `*.mcp.local` + MCPServer `my-server` in namespace `team-a` = `my-server.team-a.mcp.local`). Set explicitly to override. |
| `public-hostname`   | No       | auto    | Public hostname for the status URL. When omitted, resolved via: MCPGatewayExtension `publicHost` → public listener hostname. Set explicitly to override all auto-resolution. |
| `prefix`            | Yes      |         | Tool/prompt name prefix for federation (e.g., `myserver_`)   |
| `section-name`      | No       | `mcps`  | Gateway listener section name for the parent reference       |

### What It Creates

For each registered binding, the controller creates:

1. An **HTTPRoute** that:
    - References the specified Gateway with the configured `sectionName` (default `mcps`)
    - Sets the hostname from `route-hostname` (or auto-constructed from the listener wildcard)
    - Matches the MCPServer's path (default `/mcp`) using `PathPrefix`
    - Routes traffic to the MCPServer's Service and port

2. An **MCPServerRegistration** (`mcp.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1`) that:
    - References the HTTPRoute via `targetRef`
    - Sets the MCP server path for the broker
    - Sets the tool/prompt prefix if configured
    - State is always `Enabled`

Both resources are owned by the MCPGatewayBinding, so they are automatically deleted when the binding is removed.

### MCPServer Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: mcp.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: my-mcp-server
  namespace: default
spec:
  source:
    type: ContainerImage
    containerImage:
      ref: quay.io/containers/kubernetes_mcp_server:latest
  config:
    port: 8080
    path: /mcp
  gateway:
    provider: kuadrant
    configRef: mcp-kuadrant-config
```

### Verify

```bash
# MCPGatewayBinding should be Registered
kubectl get mcpgatewaybindings

# HTTPRoute should exist
kubectl get httproutes

# MCPServerRegistration should exist
kubectl get mcpserverregistrations

# MCPServer address should reflect the gateway URL
kubectl get mcpserver my-mcp-server -o jsonpath='{.status.address.url}'
```

## Implementing a Custom Provider

Any provider needs to:

1. Create a controller that watches `MCPGatewayBinding` resources filtered by `spec.provider`
2. Read configuration from the ConfigMap referenced by `spec.configRef`
3. Create provider-specific resources owned by the binding (for automatic cleanup)
4. Update the binding status with a `Registered` condition and optionally set `status.url`

The MCPServer controller reflects the binding status automatically - your provider only needs to manage the `MCPGatewayBinding` status, not the MCPServer status directly.

### Adding an In-Tree Provider

The operator uses a provider registry so that `cmd/main.go` does not need per-provider setup code. To add a new in-tree provider:

1. Create a package under `internal/controller/providers/<name>/`
2. Implement a `Reconciler` with a `SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error` method that uses `providers.MatchesProvider` to filter bindings by provider name:

    ```go
    package myprovider

    import (
        ctrl "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime"
        "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/builder"

        mcpv1alpha1 "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcp-lifecycle-operator/api/v1alpha1"
        "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcp-lifecycle-operator/internal/controller/providers"
    )

    const ProviderName = "myprovider"

    func init() {
        providers.Register(ProviderName, Setup)
    }

    func Setup(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
        return (&Reconciler{
            Client: mgr.GetClient(),
            Scheme: mgr.GetScheme(),
        }).SetupWithManager(mgr)
    }

    func (r *Reconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
        return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
            For(&mcpv1alpha1.MCPGatewayBinding{},
                builder.WithPredicates(providers.MatchesProvider(ProviderName))).
            // Owns(...), Watches(...), etc.
            Complete(r)
    }
    ```

3. Add a blank import in `cmd/main.go`:

    ```go
    // Gateway integration providers register themselves via init().
    // Add new providers here as blank imports.
    _ "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcp-lifecycle-operator/internal/controller/providers/httproute"
    _ "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcp-lifecycle-operator/internal/controller/providers/myprovider"
    ```

The `providers.SetupAll(mgr)` call in `cmd/main.go` handles the rest.

### Adding an Out-of-Tree Provider

An out-of-tree provider runs as a separate controller in its own deployment. It watches `MCPGatewayBinding` resources filtered by its provider name and manages its own resources independently. No changes to the operator are required - the provider needs RBAC access to watch and read `MCPGatewayBinding` resources, update their status, read referenced `ConfigMap` resources, and manage its provider-specific resources.
