# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. This page explains how to get started and where to find help.

## Getting started

Before contributing, please read the project's [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcp-lifecycle-operator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the repository. In particular:

- **[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://git.k8s.io/community/CLA.md)** — You must sign the Kubernetes CLA before we can accept your pull requests.
- **[Kubernetes Contributor Guide](https://k8s.dev/guide)** — Main contributor documentation; you can jump to the [contributing page](https://k8s.dev/docs/guide/contributing/).
- **[Contributor Cheat Sheet](https://k8s.dev/cheatsheet)** — Common resources for existing developers.

The Kubernetes community abides by the CNCF [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

## Development workflow

From the repository root:

- **Build:** `make build`
- **Format:** `make fmt`
- **Lint / vet:** `make lint`
- **Tests:** `make test` (writes `cover.out` for coverage)
- **Test coverage:** `make test` writes `cover.out`. Run `make test-cover` to refresh tests and emit `out/coverage.html` and `out/coverage.txt` (`go tool cover`). With `cover.out` present, `make cover-func` prints a per-function summary and `make cover-html` opens the interactive HTML report in a browser (local). Remove generated artifacts with `make cover-clean`.
- **Generate manifests:** `make manifests generate`

After making changes, open a pull request on GitHub. Ensure CI passes and address any review feedback.
