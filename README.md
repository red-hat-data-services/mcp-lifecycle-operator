# mcp-lifecycle-operator

A Kubernetes operator that provides a declarative API to deploy, manage, and safely roll out MCP Servers, handling their full lifecycle with production-grade automation and ecosystem integrations.

> **Note:** This project is currently in **alpha** (`v1alpha1`). APIs and behavior may change in future releases.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.28+)
- kubectl configured to access your cluster

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Operator

#### Option A: Install from Release (Recommended)

Install the operator and CRDs directly from the [latest release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcp-lifecycle-operator/releases/latest):

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcp-lifecycle-operator/releases/latest/download/install.yaml
```

This installs the CRDs, the controller Deployment, and all necessary RBAC resources in the `mcp-lifecycle-operator-system` namespace.

#### Option B: Run Locally (for Development)

Clone the repository and run the controller on your local machine:

```bash
make install  # Install the CRDs
make run      # Run the controller locally
```

Keep this terminal open. The controller logs will appear here.

#### Option C: Build and Deploy from Source

Build and deploy the controller as a Deployment in your cluster:

```bash
# Build and push the container image for multiple platforms
make docker-buildx IMG=<your-registry>/mcp-lifecycle-operator:latest

# Deploy to cluster
make deploy IMG=<your-registry>/mcp-lifecycle-operator:latest
```

Note: `docker-buildx` builds for multiple architectures (amd64, arm64, s390x, ppc64le) and pushes automatically.

### 2. Create a Test MCPServer

In a new terminal, create a test `MCPServer` resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: mcp.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: test-server
  namespace: default
spec:
  source:
    type: ContainerImage
    containerImage:
      ref: quay.io/containers/kubernetes_mcp_server:latest
  config:
    port: 8080
EOF
```

### 3. Verify the Deployment

Check that the operator created the resources:

```bash
# View the MCPServer status
kubectl get mcpservers
kubectl get mcpserver test-server -o yaml

# Verify the Deployment was created
kubectl get deployment test-server

# Verify the Service was created
kubectl get service test-server

# Verify the NetworkPolicy was created
kubectl get networkpolicy test-server

# Check the pod is running
kubectl get pods -l mcp-server=test-server
```

Expected output from `kubectl get mcpservers`:
```
NAME          READY   ACCEPTED   IMAGE                                                  PORT   ADDRESS                                               AGE
test-server   True    True       quay.io/containers/kubernetes_mcp_server:latest         8080   http://test-server.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/mcp   1m
```

The `ADDRESS` column shows the cluster-internal URL that can be used by other workloads to connect to the MCP server.

The status includes conditions and the service address for easy discovery:

```yaml
status:
  deploymentName: test-server
  serviceName: test-server
  address:
    url: http://test-server.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/mcp
  conditions:
    - type: Accepted
      status: "True"
      reason: Valid
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
      reason: Available
```

### 4. Test the Service

Port-forward to test connectivity:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/test-server 8080:8080
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz

# Test the MCP endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

You should see a response from the MCP server.

### 5. Uninstall (Optional)

To remove the CRDs and operator:

```bash
# If you installed from the release
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcp-lifecycle-operator/releases/latest/download/install.yaml

# If you deployed from source
make undeploy
make uninstall
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+

### Building

```bash
# Generate code and manifests
make manifests generate

# Build binary
make build

# Run unit tests
make test

# Run e2e tests (requires Kind)
make deploy-test-e2e   # creates Kind cluster, builds image, deploys operator
make test-e2e          # runs e2e tests against the cluster
make cleanup-test-e2e  # tears down the Kind cluster
```
